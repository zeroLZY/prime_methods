# prime_methods
collect prime generating method as many as possible

I am now writing Python. You know, Python is easy to write and read for some algrithms.
And generating prime numbers is a classical one, even somthing like the 'Hello World!' code in so many programming languages. 
The elegancy of Python produce a lot of beautiful and smart methods. 
I am trying to write,(or collect,more concisely)as many as methods for generating prime numbers.

So, if you find another different, or beautiful, or smart method, please let me know it.
Giving me a link or changing this README.md file and adding your code link is perfect.
Thank you very much.
